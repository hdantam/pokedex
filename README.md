# My Pokedex React App (Hemant Dantam)

## The app lets users scroll through every pokemon listed in the pokeapi
## It then lets them add up to 6 to a team, afterwhich the user must remove a Pokemon if they want to continue looking
## Future feature is definitely a search bar to search for a specific Pokemon
## Used firebase and uid (npm install firebase, npm install uid). I used the uid package to create unique id's for each Pokemon added to the team in firebase for easier access and removal.
